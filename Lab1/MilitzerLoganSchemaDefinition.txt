There are 6 tables in the artifact museum schema. The Artifact table has the primary key as the artifact number because it must be unique and not null. It's a varchar because the example provides letters in the string sequence. In the schema, an attribute is a varchar if alphabet characters are included in the entry. An attribute is an int or decimal depending on whether precision is required. The Employees table has the SIN as the primary key as it's a unique attribute; it's a foreign key in most tables. I separated the technician and guide entries into their own tables because they don't have the same duties; this reduces clutter in the Employees table. The Technician table states whether they're a conservationist, restorer, and their material expertise. The Guides table shows the latest exam date. The Test table to overviews the test with the test number being a primary key. A SIN attribute was added because an employee must conduct the test. The Test Details table references the test number and details the test. I chose date and time data types for 2 of the attributes in this table because that's what is required.
